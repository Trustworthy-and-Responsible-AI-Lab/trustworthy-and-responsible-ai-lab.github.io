                <p>
                    <b style="color: #D73F09;">
                    [Due] Before each class.</b><br/>
                    (<i>e.g.</i>, the deadline for Monday's class papers is 11:59:59 AM on Monday.)<br/><br/>

                    The required readings are posted on the course <a href="syllabus.html">syllabus</a>, and you need to write a critique for <span style="color: #D73F09">one out of the 2 papers</span> per class. In the syllabus, you sometimes find <b>[Bonus]</b> papers, but you shouldn't choose them for this. Keep in mind that this is not light pleasure reading. You may require to read a few more relevant papers to understand the reading materials. After you are used to this reading, it may take 2-3 hours to read each paper.<br/><br/>

                    Your critique for each paper <b>MUST</b> have the following fields:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Summary of the paper</li>
                        <li>Contributions (typically 2-3 for each paper)</li>
                        <li>Strengths and weaknesses (2-3 for each)</li>
                        <li>Your opinions</li>
                    </ul>

                    Please make your best effort to write concise and precise statements. For example: <br/><br/>
                    <ul>
                        <li><b>In the summary,</b> it is better to write statements that are more summarizing than descriptive. A common mistake is to write "this paper proposed a methodology..." This isn't valuable for you later on; you can write "the key idea (or intuition) of this paper is XYZ."</li>

                        <li><b>Contributions / strengths / weaknesses.</b> You need to extract the essence---what the authors really want us to remember about the paper. For example, the fact that the research is well-evaluated is not a contribution; it's necessary for the authors to convey their ideas. Similarly, bad writing is not a weakness for our purposes. You can mention them in the "opinions" field.</li>
                    </ul>

                    In your critiques, I will look for evidence that you thought about the problem discussed in the paper; you incorporated personal experience, you looked for how the security issues of machine learning discussed in the paper are addressed today, and so on. Think critically about the paper and do not accept the authors' opinions <i>as-is</i>. <b>It is the authors' job to convince you!</b><br/><br/>

                    Here, I also share a sample critique of mine for reference [<a href="" target="_blank">example</a>].<br/>

                    <li><b>1 point:</b> You made an effort to understand the papers / you also carefully think about the pros and cons of the papers.</li>
                    <li><b>2 points:</b> You make an insightful comment.</li>

                    You may <i>opt-in</i> for scribing a lecture note. Note that this is an opportunity to receive extra points (+5); you can sign-up only once throughout the term. You can understand and remember the lecture materials better, and the scribed notes will be useful for students who did not attend the class. Please use Canvas to sign-up for this opportunity. Max. 2 students will be allowed to sign-up for each class. In this case, the write-up should be <i>a joint effort</i>; please schedule time to meet your co-scriber.<br/><br/>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Outline:</b> an outline of key topics covered in each class.</li>

                    Please use this Latex template [<a href="https://www.overleaf.com/read/kxvtwxphnpsb" target="_blank">link</a>] for the notes. Note that I expected your note to be 3-4 pages long, at the minimum. I may ask for edits. As for your reference, I also share the scribe note that I did in the past [<a href="resources/scribe_note_sample.pdf" target="_blank">link</a>]. Once approved, your notes will be publicly available on the course website.
